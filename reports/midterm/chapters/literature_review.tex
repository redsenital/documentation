\chapter{Literature Review}

The following review examines significant advancements in automated web security testing, with a particular focus on XSS payload generation and adversarial input synthesis. Existing research covers a wide spectrum of techniques, including reinforcement learning, neural machine translation, generative adversarial models, and transformer-based language approaches. By analyzing these contributions, this review highlights the methodological trends, strengths, and limitations that shape the design and development of the Red Sentinel system.

\section{Research Gaps and Opportunities}

While existing research demonstrates the potential of machine learning in automated XSS detection and payload generation, several gaps remain:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Limited Context Awareness:} Most existing systems treat contexts as discrete categories rather than continuous semantic spaces, limiting their ability to handle novel or hybrid injection points.
    
    \item \textbf{Obfuscation Integration:} Few systems integrate obfuscation as a first-class component of the payload generation pipeline, relying instead on post-processing transformations.
    
    \item \textbf{Evaluation Frameworks:} Standardized benchmarks for comparing payload generators across different contexts and filtering mechanisms are lacking.
    
    \item \textbf{Byte-Level Precision:} Most language models operate at word or subword levels, potentially missing character-level patterns critical for XSS exploitation.
\end{enumerate}

Red Sentinel addresses these gaps by implementing byte-level tokenization, integrated obfuscation, modular architecture, and comprehensive context modeling through transformer-based sequence-to-sequence learning.
